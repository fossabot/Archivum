Database frontend for storing and processing structured data within a single table.

## Work in progress

The project is currently under heavy development.

Current focus is on getting it into a workable state - basic record editing and queries.

The code has many TODOs and will need refinements, for now I'm mostly tracking my progress, after I finish the above milestone I'll cleanup the code to welcome possible contributions, also a user guide will be on the way.
